        <h3>Public Relations and I</h3>
        <br />
         <div id="pr-intro">
             <p>Whether in a Starbucks coffee shop, an overnight youth hostel, or a compartment of train, I like to start a conversation with the person who gives me a good first impression. This is how I explore the world. </p>
               <p>As I grow up, this habit extends into a professional goal for <strong>public relations</strong>. In 2009, I joined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIESEC" target="_blank">AIESEC</a>, an international student-run organization for global exchange and youth potential development. I gained precious experiences in management, promotion, and external relations from an international project, <a href="http://www.marinedream.org/project-007.php" target="_blank">Green Power Project</a> in which I was a  regional coordinator. See the outline and review of <a href="http://xzhu891128.wix.com/portfolio#!communications/cbm1" target="_blank"> my Green Power Project</a> (now named ACTION!BLUE).</p>   
                 <p>Apparently, I strive to make myself a public liaison in my beloved dance and performing arts industry.</p>

            <strong><p><em>"I don’t think the ways, the popularity of live performance will ever go away. It’s just always going to be a process where audience tastes might be, and people like the spectacle."</em></p></strong>

          <p><strong><em>“I think dance needs a lot of help from public relations.  And I feel it is kind of presenting dance in a way that people can relate to.”  </em></strong></p>
          <p><strong><em>"I really hope I am providing an experience…so through looking there, maybe you can connect with things that are completely personal for you…so dance in a way is not about anything particular, it’s kind of about what you make it.”</em></strong></p>

             <h3>My Current PR Campaign</h3>

       <h4>Dance Link Click Project</h4> 
            <br />
             <p>Every dancer is unique, not only under the limelight, but also in the virtual world.  While high technology preserves the ephemeral beauty of dance works, it also challenges dancers to establish unique dance identities outside the stage. 
        </p>
        <p>Also, no dancer can better thrive in a small community today. Inspirations and mutual benefits come from the world outside, especially the Internet. No matter what you are looking for—industrial information, employers’ updates, or cooperation with other dancers—an online platform with social media tools is thus necessary to maximize your artistic outcomes. </p>
        <p>These give birth to Dance Link Click. A dance platform assists dancers to extend motion beauty to the internet and also transform online connections to offline activities and career benefits. Its ultimate goal is to enrich the dance life and develop the professional path based on each individual’s needs. See the <a href="Proposal.pdf" target="blank">project proposal</a></p>
