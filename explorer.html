       <div id="about-me">
       <p>My mum always said, “Life should not be resigned to the status quo. It is poetic and faraway.” With this cultivation, I have grown up to be a <strong>life explorer</strong>, mentally and physically alike. In my early twenties, I have devoted great passions in <strong>travel</strong> and <strong>art</strong>. Of course, many other attractive things will later pop out into my life, yet my self-exploration has helped me to find out several essentials in which <strong>dance </strong>and <strong>communications</strong> are what I determine to follow. Now being a

        <p>    Art is long, but life is short. It provides me with endless inspirations and fulfillments. Ever since the primary school, I have begun to depict the world by strokes and colors. Later in the high school, I fell in love with dance and from street dance, ballroom, to ballet, I persisted this interest till now. In my spare time, I am a constant museum-goer and a huge fan for all kinds of artisanal designs, films, and music. I also like to think and write about art issues. </p>
       <p>My unforgettable art experiences in America include the visits of a series of art museums in New York City where I spent a whole day in the Metropolitan Museum on sketching and the enjoyment of the classic Broadway show: the Phantom of the Opera. In the summer 2013, I also volunteered as a MUSE in Samuel. P Harn Museum at University of Florida during which I developed and implemented art programming for Museum Night with students from different cultural backgrounds.  </p>

          <br />
               <p>A famous Chinese saying goes, “Travelling thousands of miles is better than reading thousands of books.” At the age of 16, I began my first adventure in 5 European countries (Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg) with the high school’s summer camp. During my undergraduate years, I went to Beijing, Chengdu, two watery towns in the south of China, and the Northwest of China as a backpacker. So far, I have set my footprints in Japan, the south of America, and Cancun in Mexico. </p>
               <p>Travel has indeed broadened my horizon and sharpened my wits. I became open-minded and increasingly curious about the world I haven’t touched. It makes me resolute to live in a country with diverse cultures and beliefs. This is a main reason that I came to America for my advanced education.
